Which engine will we use or will we create our own?
Will we build our own models or outsource the work? Is outsourcing allowed?


Powerup ideas:
Explosives
Rocket boosters
Basic attack? (without powerup and possibly with a cooldown) - maybe specific to each character




Movement Mechanics:
Rolling around or walking/running
