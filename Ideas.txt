Which engine will we use or will we create our own?
Will we build our own models or outsource the work? Is outsourcing allowed?
Will the game be played locally? (would likely require controller support)



Powerup ideas:
Explosives
Rocket boosters
Basic attack? (without powerup and possibly with a cooldown) - maybe specific to each character
Time slowing
Immovability/Anchor




Movement Mechanics:
Rolling around or walking/running
Different characters could have their own specific movement ability (with cooldown)



UI:
What information will be shown?
