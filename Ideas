Questiions:
  1) What game engine are we going to use? (Unity vs Unreal vs none)
          (We should try to create a demo in each way to find problems with each)
          
  2) What art styke are we going to use? 
          (Making everything realistic is impossible because we don't have a team of 100. Somebody needs to experiment with Blender)
          
  3) What are we going to balance our game around? (Different characters, or same character and different pick ups or different loadouts)

  4) Will the game be played locally or via a network? (locally would likely require controller support)

  5) What information will be shown in the game's UI?


Powerup ideas:
  Explosives
  Rocket boosters
  Basic attack? (without powerup and possibly with a cooldown) - maybe specific to each character
  Time slowing
  Immovability/Anchor




Movement Mechanics:
  Rolling around or walking/running?
  Different characters could have their own specific movement ability (with cooldown)
