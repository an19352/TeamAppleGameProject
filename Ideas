Questiions:
  1) What game engine are we going to use? (Unity vs Unreal vs none)
          (We should try to create a demo in each way to find problems with each)
          
  2) What art styke are we going to use? 
          (Making everything realistic is impossible because we don't have a team of 100. Somebody needs to experiment with Blender)
          
  3) What are we going to balance our game around? (Different characters, or same character and different pick ups or different loadouts)
